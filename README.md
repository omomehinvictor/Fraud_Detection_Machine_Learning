# Detecting Fraud in African custom service using Machine learning algorithms.

The increasing amounts of imports and exports have served good purpose in many African countries and as well as avenue for fraud criminals to carry out their illicit acts in form of tax evasion, smugglings, money laundering, drugs trafficking etc. These very acts made it paramount for the government to find automatic or semi-automatic solutions to guide the customsâ€™ activities in order to minimize the number of manual inspection of imports. In this notebook we use various machine learning techniques to detect if a transaction in a Africa custom service is fraud or not via Python implementation.
